## coolbot

#### I created coolbot as a way to keep track of my own personal Minecraft server without having to RDP into the server or log into Minecraft each time. I then decided it could help me moderate the Discord server of the Minecraft server so I added small pieces of functionality such as kicking and banning users.

Challenges: Trying to read the documentation of Discord.js was a mountain to climb on its own. 

I would love to go back and add more functionality to it such as playing YouTube audio, changing roles of users, and messaging users the rules of the Minecraft server.

Technologies: JavaScript, Discord.js
